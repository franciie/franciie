## Hi there, my name is Franzi ðŸ‘‹

I recently started studying Computer Science in October 2024!

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Harvard University's online course "[CS50](https://pll.harvard.edu/course/cs50-introduction-computer-science)'s Introduction to Computer Science" (atm Problem Set 9) to gain practical experience.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about Flask, and I am very excited to start working on my CS50 final project soon and apply the skills I learned so far.
